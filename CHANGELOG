==== 11.02.2012
- refactored to fit for any ruby app, and removed rails dependency - also use rspec instead of rspec-rails
- moved everything under AmberbitConfig namespace
- added more tests
- new features:
  - HashStruct#to_hash
  - HashStruct validation of specified keys, if they are not in conflict with existing methods
  - HashStruct raise error if it tries to access unset variable
  - Config is now beeing parsed with ERB first
